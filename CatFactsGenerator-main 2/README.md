This project is made to show an example of MVVM architecture in Android using Retrofit and Java

NB : I developed the whole functionality of pagination until I realized that all pages are always random
in this API, and when you go back, it doesn't show the previous page you got ...
At least, it can give you an example of such architectures, and if the API was correctly configured
the pagination would works
